# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In this project I created a webpage for my Prework Study Guide in order to make the information organized and easily accessible for me to study. While working on this project, I learned how to create feature branches for each separate file, push changes to Git Hub, and then create pull requests to merge new changes to the main branch. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learned how to link each file to my main branch by using their respective tags in the code. I also learned how to incorporate variables, conditional statements, and functions in my code.
